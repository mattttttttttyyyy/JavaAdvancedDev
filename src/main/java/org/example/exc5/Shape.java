Create an abstract class named Shape with abstract methods calculatePerimeter()
for calculating the perimeter and calculateArea() for calculating the area.
        Create classes Rectangle, Triangle, Hexagon extending the Shape class,
        and implement the abstract methods accordingly. Verify the correctness of the program.
        Create an abstract class named 3DShape extending the Shape class from the previous exercise.
        Add an abstract method named calculateVolume().
Create classes named Cone and Cube extending the 3DShape class,
respectively implementing the abstract methods. Test the correctness of the implementation.
